# xv6 Operating System for RISC-V
Implementation by Nathan Chin

## About
All of the resources in `book/` and the starter files in `os/` were created for instructional purposes by faculty and researchers at MIT for the course 6.S081: Operating System Engineering. While the course normally builds upon an x86 version of the xv6 operating system, which is a re-implementation of Unix Version 6, this version of xv6 is modified for RISC-V. 

This course teaches on the design and implementation of operating systems, and their use as a foundation for systems programming. Topics include virtual memory; file systems; threads; context switches; kernels; interrupts; system calls; interprocess communication; coordination, and interaction between software and hardware. The multi-processor operating system for RISC-V that is xv6 is used to illustrate these topics. Lab assignments involve extending the xv6 operatin system, for example to support sophisticated virtual memory features and network protocols.

## What I am doing
In an attempt to re-learn important operating system topics, I will be completing the labs for the MIT course, 6.S081, as described on their [course website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/overview.html). These labs will be completed on my own, and tested with the provided scripts. VirtualBox was used to provide a Linux Mint environment for development on a Windows machine.

## What is completed:
- [x] Lab Utilities
- [x] Lab Shell
- [ ] Lab Allocator
- [ ] Lab Lazy allocation
- [ ] Lab Copy on-write
- [ ] Lab Uthread and alarm
- [ ] Lab Lock
- [ ] Lab File system
- [ ] Lab mmap
- [ ] Lab network driver

## Credit to the creators
I am claiming no credit for my own except for the implementations of the labs listed on the course website (linked above). Thanks to MIT 6.S081/6.828 for providing the resources to getting me started.
