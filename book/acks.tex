\chapter*{Foreword and acknowledgements}


This is a draft text intended for a class on operating systems. It
explains the main concepts of operating systems by studying an example
kernel, named xv6.  xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and
Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6)~\cite{unix}.  xv6 loosely follows the structure
and style of v6, but is implemented in ANSI C~\cite{kernighan} for 
a multicore RISC-V~\cite{riscv}.

This text should be read along with the source code for xv6, an approach 
inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition~\cite{lions}. See
\url{https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828} for pointers to on-line
resources for v6 and xv6, including several hands-on homework assignments
using xv6.

We have used this text in 6.828, the operating systems class at MIT.
We thank the faculty, teaching assistants, and students of 6.828 who
have all directly or indirectly contributed to xv6.  In particular, we
would like to thank Austin Clements and Nickolai Zeldovich.  Finally,
we would like to thank people who emailed us bugs in the text or
suggestions for improvements: Abutalib Aghayev, Sebastian Boehm, Anton
Burtsev, Raphael Carvalho, Tej Chajed, Rasit Eskicioglu, Color Fuzzy, Giuseppe,
